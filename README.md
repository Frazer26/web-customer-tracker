Elevator pitch
------------------------
FOR the managers
WHO want to see through their customers
THE 'Customer Relationship Managment'
IS a web-browser-based CRM system
WHICH enables the user to list the customers and add new ones
UNLIKE other CRM systems
MY PRODUCT 	is running in a simple web-browser without installation,
			trivial to use,
			and it was created by me for learning and enjoying what I learned on the online lessons.
